EOS architecture specification
==============================

This is the architecture specification for EOS project. This document specifies
the architecture of EOS software, hardware and also processes involved in
development of EOS, its deployment, maintenance and evolution.

Overall system description
==========================

The goal of EOS is to develop a generic object store solution. An EOS deployment
consists of sofware (to be developed as part of the project) installed on
Seagate hardware assembled on the customer's premises (so called *private
cloud*). Access to the data is through the industry standard interfaces: `S3
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3>`_ and `NFS
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System>`_. EOS includes `RAS
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability,_availability_and_serviceability>`_,
provisioning, cluster management and monitoring UI.

**Add some high level marketing justification.**

High level decomposition
========================

At the highest level, EOS consists of software, hardware, and processes for its
development, deployment, maintenance and evolution.

Top-level software components are:

    - mero [`mero <component.mero_>`_]: a scalable storage software providing object store and
      key-value store interfaces;

    - halon [`halon <component.halon_>`_]: a high-availability sub-system that monitors and manages
      other software and hardware components;

    - s3 [`s3 <component.s3_>`_]: an implementation of s3 server using mero to store data
      and meta-data;

    - nfs [`nfs <component.nfs_>`_]: an implementation of nfs server, based on open source
      `Ganesha <https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha/wiki>`_, using mero
      to store data and meta-data;

    - provisioner [`provisioner <component.provisioner_>`_];

    - RAS [`ras <component.ras_>`_];

    - management interface (cli and gui) [`managementui <component.managementui_>`_];

    - operating system [`os <component.os_>`_].

The software components listed above are *deployed* software, that is, they
execute on the EOS deployments. In addition, EOS includes *non-deployed software*:

    - test scripts;

    - RE infrastructure;

    - continuous intergration infrastructure;

    - debugging tools;

    - development tools, like VM images.

EOS hardware is organised hierarchically into:

    - a deployment [`deployment <entity.deployment_>`_], which is a collection of

    - clusters [`cluster <entity.cluster_>`_], each corresponding to an s3 region
      [`s3.region <entity.s3.region_>`_], consisting of

    - sites [`site <entity.site_>`_], also known as *data centres*, corresponding to an s3
      *availability zone*, consisting of

    - racks [`rack <entity.rack_>`_], consisting of

      - top-of-the-rack network switches [`switch <entity.switch_>`_],

      - management server nodes (CMU) [`cmu <entity.cmu_>`_],

      - storage servers [`ss <entity.ss_>`_],

      - data enclosures [`enclosure <entity.enclosure_>`_], including

        - PODS controllers [`pods <entity.pods_>`_] to which attached are

	  - storage devices.

Hardware units are *failure domains* [`failuredomain <entity.failuredomain_>`_].

Components
==========

EOS software is decomposed into components, also called modules. Modules
interact with each other through defined interfaces or protocols, can be
planned, estimated and developed independently.

This section contains informal overview of the components and can be read in
sequential order to get an overview of the eos. Formal descriptions are given in
the appropriate entries of the `Encyclop√¶dia`_.

.. _component.eos:

eos
---

Top-level component, containing all deployed EOS software.

:Parent:
:Sub-components: [`mero <component.mero_>`_], [`s3 <component.s3_>`_], [`nfs <component.nfs_>`_], [`halon <component.halon_>`_],
                 [`provisioner <component.provisioner_>`_], [`ras <component.ras_>`_], [`managementui <component.managementui_>`_], [`os <component.os_>`_]

.. _component.mero:

mero
----

Mero is a distributed storage system, targeting exascale configurations. Its
main roots are Lustre file system, NFSv4 and database technology. Mero is not,
strictly speaking, a file system: an emerging consensus is that traditional file
system properties (hierarchical directory namespace, strong POSIX consistency
guarantees, etc.) are no longer desirable or achievable at exascale. Nor Mero is
an object store. Instead, Mero is a more general storage system, providing an
optional file system and object store interfaces. This allows wider range of
deployments, including cloud.

Mero controls a cluster consisting of nodes connected by network. Some nodes
have persistent storage attached to them. Mero makes distinction between various
types of persistent store:

    - rotational drives. They have low cost per bit, good durability, widely
      available. Their drawbacks include high latency (due to rotational and
      seek delays) and ever decreasing bandwidth-to-capacity ratio;

    - flash drives. They are more expensive per bit, have limited capacity per
      drive, no seek latency, good throughput;

    - non-volatile memory of various types, including PCI-attached flash
      devices, battery-backed memory and phase-change memory. Even more
      expensive and even faster.

Some nodes are running applications [`application <entity.application_>`_], which are processes
external to Mero. Applications issue requests to query or manipulate cluster
state. An application can be a traditional user space application, running
standalone on a node, or a large MPI job running on multiple nodes, or a cluster
management utility monitoring the state of the system, or S3 [`s3 <entity.s3_>`_] or NFS
[`nfs <entity.nfs_>`_] or CIFS daemon exporting Mero to non-Mero clients.

.. image:: images/mero.layers.png

The ultimate effect of operation execution consists of updates and queries to
state on multiple nodes.

Remote execution requires network communication. Mero rpc layer [`rpc <entity.rpc_>`_]
handles certain network failures (message loss) and provides convenient
interface to send items, which are internally packed in network messages.

Distributed transaction manager [`dtm <entity.dtm_>`_] allows operations to be grouped into
distributed transactions, which are guaranteed to be atomic in the face of
certain failures.

Main novel ideas of Mero, that distinguish it from other cluster file-systems or
object stores are:

    - fdmi [`fdmi <entity.fdmi_>`_];

    - file operations log [`fol <entity.fol_>`_];

    - fops [`fop <entity.fop_>`_];

    - distributed transaction manager [`dtm <entity.dtm_>`_];

    - resource manager [`rm <entity.rm_>`_];

    - layouts [`layout <entity.layout_>`_], including parity de-clustering [`pdclust <entity.pdclust_>`_];

    - containers [`container <entity.container_>`_];

    - addb [`addb <entity.addb_>`_].

mero.clovis
-----------

clovis [`clovis <entity.clovis_>`_] is the external interface exported by mero. Clovis consists
of two main parts:

    - access interface, object IO, key-value indices and distributed
      transactions and

    - fdmi interface [`fdmi <entity.fdmi_>`_] used to extend the core system with new
      functionality.

Clovis is used by applications [`application <entity.application_>`_] including *native* applications
(directly using clovis) and *front-ends*, which are applications exporting
conventional interfaces such as posix, nfs, cifs, s3, etc.

A typical application uses clovis by linking with libmero.so shared library
[`mero.library <entity.mero.library_>`_] and using functions defined in clovis.h header file. A linux
kernel component uses clovis by loading mero kernel module.

Where

**core** are the people responsible for specifying the software task to be done,
controlling the execution and quality. Different members of the core can be
responsible for different aspects of core activity: producing a specification,
inspecting designs and code.

**team** are the people writing the detailed designs, code, doing the testing,
 etc.

**ci** is the continuous integration infrastructure.

**specification** is a document or a set of documents describing the software
task with sufficient detail to start the development. A specification can be
either a high-level design specification [`hld <entity.hld_>`_] or a modification
specification [`modification <entity.modification_>`_]. An hld is used for development of a new
feature [`feature <entity.feature_>`_] or component [`component <entity.component_>`_]. A modification is used for
changing an existing component.

**execution plan** [`execution.plan <entity.execution.plan_>`_] specifies the timeline of the task
execution and required resources. It includes:

    - estimation for execution phases (dld, coding, testing, etc.);

    - division of implementation into smaller sub-tasks usable for continuous
      integration;

    - testing plan.

**dld** [`dld <entity.dld_>`_]

**dld inspection** [`dldinsp <entity.dldinsp_>`_]

**code inspection** [`codeinsp <entity.codeinsp_>`_]

The sequence diagram above is simplified in certain aspects for readability. For
example, it assumes that a dld never changes as a result of coding or testing.

.. _usecase.durability.bitrot:

durability.bitrot
-----------------

This is a case when a bit rot happens on a drive. It's not detected by the drive
itself and there is no error code returned on attempt to read the rotten data.

Bit rot is detected when someone (either application or BSC service) reads the
rotten data. After it's detected BSC service will try to
`repair (bsc.repair) <bsc.repair_>`_ the missing piece using the SNS parity
algorithm.

This diagram describes how the bit rot is detected when a Clovis application
tries to read the data.

.. uml::

  participant drive
  participant ioservice
  participant BSC
  participant Clovis
  participant Application

  note over drive: bit rot happens
  Application -> Clovis: read I/O request
  Clovis -> ioservice: read I/O request
  ioservice -> drive: read stob I/O
  drive -> ioservice: OK
  ioservice -> ioservice: check DI checksum: FAILED
  ioservice -> Clovis: read I/O error
  note over Clovis: continue with degraded read
  Clovis -> Application: read I/O request data
  ioservice -> BSC: repair request
  note over BSC: not execute the request right now
  BSC -> ioservice:

bsc.repair
~~~~~~~~~~

Then BSC service handles the rotten data:

.. uml::

  participant drive
  participant ios_node1
  participant ios_node2
  participant BSC

  note over BSC: repair request for a unit (D or P)

  note over BSC: mark the unit as BAD\n(so subsequent reads return I/O failure)
  BSC -> ios_node1: read a unit
  BSC -> ios_node2: read a unit
  ios_node1 -> BSC: done
  note over BSC: parity calculations for available units
  ios_node2 -> BSC: done
  note over BSC: parity calculations for the unit
  note over BSC: DI check for the unit\n(compare againts the stored data)
  BSC -> drive: write new calculated data to the unit
  drive -> BSC: done
  note over BSC: the repair request is done
  note over drive, BSC
  Error cases
  1. > K failures in the PG for the unit being repaired
  2. Process restart when handling the repair request
  3. DI mismatch (no decision yet)
  4. Intermittent write I/O failure (expander reset etc.) (no decision yet).
  5. Persistence of the repair request (decision: YES).
  6. DI checksum for the DIX keys/values (no decision yet).
  endnote

The rotten data can be overwritten:

.. uml::

  participant Application
  participant Clovis
  participant ioservice
  participant stob

  Application -> Clovis: write I/O request for a unit
  Clovis -> ioservice: write I/O request for the unit
  ioservice -> stob: write I/O request
  note over stob: move the unit to the BAD list
  note over stob: do the write I/O normally
  stob -> ioservice: done
  ioservice -> Clovis: done
  Clovis -> Application: done

.. _usecase.s3.iamuserpolicy:

s3.iamuserpolicy
---------------

IAM user policy specify what operations are allowed or denied on resources of service like S3. IAM user policies are attached to IAM users, groups, or roles. It defines what a user can do in a environment.
IAM policy are used for managing access to multiple services in a environment. In EOS access management is required only for S3 service, hence IAM polcy is currently not supported. All S3 service access management can by done using ACL and Bucket policy.

.. _usecase.s3.crr:

s3.crr
------

Cross-region replication (CRR) enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different Regions. Buckets configured for cross-region replication can be owned by the same account or by different accounts.

.. image:: images/s3.crr.png

In case of setting s3 policies for CRR, there may be two approaches which can be
followed.

:Approach 1:
S3server sends REST API request to remote S3server(S3server in another Region)
to get remote bucket metadata or to trigger COPY Object. This approach is secure.

:Approach 2:
S3server uses Mero to get remote bucket metadata or to trigger COPY Object.

Approach 1 is recommended as it seems to be secure.

.. _usecase.s3.crr.put.policies:

s3.crr.put.policies
-------------------

:Approach 1:

This is the case when we want to enable Cross Region replication(CRR), we add
a replication configuration to our source bucket, the configuration tells the
S3Server to replicate objects as specified. In the replication configuration we
provide the destination bucket and the objects we want to replicate. PUT Bucket
Policies either creates a replication policies or replaces existing one.

This diagram describes how the s3 CRR policy is applied to the source bucket.

.. uml::

  skinparam BoxPadding 10

  participant "S3Client1"
  participant "Haproxy1"
  participant "S3Server1"

    2) Check buckets are in different region or not.
    3) Permission to replicate objects from the source to the destination bucket.

.. _usecase.s3.crr.put.object:

-----------------

:Approach 1:

This is the case when we PUT object to the source bucket
which has CRR policy set. Async replication of the uploaded
object takes place to the remote bucket,after the object is uploaded
locally.

Below diagram describes how replication happens to the destination bucket
once user has already applied the replication policy to the source bucket.

  == Replicate object to region2 end ==

:Approach 2:

This is the case when we PUT object to the source bucket
which has CRR policy set. Async replication of the uploaded
object takes place to the remote bucket,after the object is uploaded
locally. In this approach communication happens between local Mero(Region1) and remote
Mero(Region 2) to get the remote metadata or object replication.

once user has already applied the replication policy to the source bucket.

.. _usecase.s3.versioning:

s3.versioning
-------------

Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your S3 bucket. With versioning, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.

s3.bucket.put.versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PUT operation uses the versioning subresource to set the versioning state of an existing bucket. To set the versioning state, you must be the bucket owner.

You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:
	- Enabled:Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.
	- Suspended: Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

.. uml::

  title PUT Bucket versioning
  participant "S3Client" as A
  participant "HAproxy" as B
  participant "S3Server" as C
  participant "S3Auth" as D
  participant "Mero-ios" as E
  participant "Mero-dix" as F

  A->B:PUT Bucket versioning
  B->C:PUT Bucket versioning
  C->D: Do auth
  C<--D: 200 OK
  C->F: Get-KV(bucket)
  C<--F: Response - Get-KV(bucket)
  note over C: Update versioning metadata
  C->F: PUT-KV (bucket)
  C<--F: PUT KV (bucket) Response - OK
  B<--C: Response - 200 Ok
  A<--B: Response - 200 Ok

s3.bucket.get.versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GET operation uses the versioning subresource to return the versioning state of a bucket. To retrieve the versioning state of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.

.. uml::

  title GET Bucket versioning
  participant "S3Client" as A
  participant "HAproxy" as B
  participant "S3Server" as C
  participant "S3Auth" as D
  participant "Mero-ios" as E
  participant "Mero-dix" as F

  A->B:GET Bucket versioning
  B->C:GET Bucket versioning
  C->D: Do auth
  C<--D: 200 OK
  C->F: Get-KV(bucket)
  C<--F: Response - Get-KV(bucket)
  note over C: get bucket versioning metadata information
  B<--C: (Versioning info) Response - 200 Ok
  A<--B: (Versioning info) Response - 200 Ok

s3.object.put.versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you enable versioning for a bucket, S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. S3 returns this ID in the response using the x-amz-version-id response header. If versioning is suspended, S3 always uses null as the version ID for the object stored.

.. uml::

  title PUT Object versioning
  participant "S3Client" as A
  participant "HAproxy" as B
  participant "S3Server" as C
  participant "S3Auth" as D
  participant "Mero-ios" as E
  participant "Mero-dix" as F

  A->B:PUT Object
  B->C:PUT Object
  C->D: Do authentication
  C<--D: 200 OK
  C->F: Get-KV(bucket)
  C<--F: Response - Get-KV(bucket)
  note over C: Check versioning enabled or not.\n1. If enabled, generates a unique version ID\nfor the object being stored.\n2. If Disabled,  always use null as the version ID\nfor the object stored.
  C->E:Create object
  C<--E:Responce Ok
   loop Write data
    |||
    A->B: Incoming Write Data
    B->C: Incoming Write Data
    C->E: Write Data
    C<--E: Write Data - Response - Ok
    |||
    end
  alt versioning == true
    C -> C : generate unique VersionID
  else versioning == false
    C -> C : Set VersionID to null
  end
  C->F: Put-KV(Object Index: versionID-->metadata)
  C<--F: Response - Put-KV(Object Index: versionID-->metadata))=
  C->F: Put-KV (update latest object in object list index)
  C<--F: Response - Put-KV (update latest object in object list index)
  B<--C: (Versioning info) Response - 200 Ok
  A<--B: (Versioning info) Response - 200 Ok

s3.object.get.versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the GET operation returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the versionId subresource.

.. uml::

  title Get Object of specific version
  participant "S3Client" as A
  participant "HAproxy" as B
  participant "S3Server" as C
  participant "S3Auth" as D
  participant "Mero-ios" as E
  participant "Mero-dix" as F

  A->B:Get Object of specific version
  B->C:Get Object of specific version
  C->D: Do authentication
  C<--D: 200 OK
  C->F: Get-KV(bucket)
  C<--F: Response - Get-KV(bucket)
  C->F: Get-KV(object metadata)
  C<--F: Response - Get-KV(object metadata)
  alt given versioniID == avialable
      loop read data
      |||
      C->E: Read Data
      C<--E: Read Data - Response - Ok
      B<--C: send Data
      A<--B: send Data
      |||
      end
      B<--C: Response - 200 Ok
      A<--B: Response - 200 Ok
  else given versioniID != avialable
   B<--C: (NoSuchObject with given verison) Response - 404 Not Found 
   A<--B: (NoSuchObject with given verison) Response - 404 Not Found 
  end

s3.object.delete.versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DELETE operation removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current version of the object. If there isn't a null version, S3 does not remove any objects.

To remove a specific version permanently, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the versionId subresource.

.. uml::

  title DELETE Object
  participant "S3Client" as A
  participant "HAproxy" as B
  participant "S3Server" as C
  participant "S3Auth" as D
  participant "Mero-ios" as E

    note over C: Insert delete marker with newly generated VersionID
    C->F: Put-KV(Object Index: versionID-->metadata)
    C<--F: Response - Put-KV(Object Index: versionID-->metadata))
  else versioning == false (currently is suspended, but previously enabled)
    C -> C : Set VersionID to null
    note over C:  Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object\n and inserts a delete marker.
    C->F: Put-KV(Object Index: versionID-->metadata)
    C<--F: Response - Put-KV(Object Index: versionID-->metadata))
  else versioning == false (Never enabled)
    note over C: Delete the object
    C->E: Delete the object
    C->E: Responce - OK
    C->F: Delete-KV(remove meatdata)

  end
  B<--C: Response - 200 Ok
  A<--B: Response - 200 Ok 

.. _usecase.s3.throttling:

s3.throttling
-------------

Throttling is a process that is used to control the usage of GET/PUT object APIs by accounts during a given period.

.. uml::

  else throttle
    B <-- C : Response - SlowDown
    A <-- B : Response - SlowDown
  end

.. _usecase.s3.copy.object:

s3.copy.object
--------------

The copy operation creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Mero. One can create
a copy of the object upto some size (To be defined) in a single atomic operation. For copying an object that
is greater than some size (To be defined), one must use multipart upload API. Below are the some of the uses
of copy operation.

 - Create additional copies of objects
 - Rename objects by copying them and deleting original ones
 - Change object metadata

.. uml::

.. _usecase.s3.copy.part:

s3.copy.part
------------

For copying an existing object one may use the Upload Part (Copy) API and specify the source object by adding
the x-amz-copy-source request header in the request. First we initiate multipart upload, in response we
get upload id. Then upload a part by copying data from an existing object as data source.

.. uml::

--------------------

This usecase assumes that CAS2 is permanetly failed and needs full
data restoration. During this process, dix.get(), put(), del()
operation continue to be handled on DIX and CAS side, untill more that
K CAS failures happen. In case of transient CAS failure DTM0 (which
has to be defined) has to orchestrate the process of redo-log replay
by means of creating distributed transaction.

.. _usecase.ras.fault.handle.pods.vdisk:

ras.fault.handle.pods.vdisk
---------------------------

PODS exposes virtual disks over erasure coded physical disks to survive one or more disk failures. MERO will use these virtual disks, as the underlying device, for both metadata and data. When one or more disks fail, PODS automatically handles those internally, by performing repairs. However as more number of disks starts to fail, PODS reduces to the vdisk capacity to compensate initially, or may even fail the vdisk.

SSPL integrated with PODS and subscribes to the events. In case of failure
events, SSPL detects and reports the same on the RabbitMQ channel. Halon
and Dashboard retrieve this informaion from RabbitMQ. Dashboard displays
an alert to user, while Halon records it and initiates repair process.

When administrator configures new vdisk and adds it to the pool, Halon
initiates rebalance. Once rebalance completes, Halon notifies SSPL
which in turn sends notification to Dashboard to clear the alert.

.. _usecase.ras.fault.handle.pods.fru:

ras.fault.handle.pods.fru
-------------------------

PODS FRUs like Fans, Power Supplies, Sideplane SAS expanders, disk drives, etc,
failure and rectification events are received by SSPL. SSPL observes PODS FRU
state change events and publishes the same on RabbitMQ channel and also records
them onto the syslog. Dashboard publishes failure alerts to notify administrators.
Administrators, with the help of Seagate support, can initiate the FRU replacement
process. As soon as a new component is added, SSPL receives a notification from PODS
and the same will be forwarded to Halon for a relevant action if applicable.

Support bundle aims at obtaining all possible debug information from the EOS system in the event of system issues. The support bundle creation process includes two things:

1. Running debug commands and obtaining the output
2. Obtaining log files

The information is obtained from all the noes, in parallel. Finally information is stored in a compressed archive form, so that it can be sent to the support team.

Halon will send a login request for authentication containing user credentials to SSPL. SSPL will contact Authentication Server to check validity of supplied user credentials and get a security token if user is valid. That security token will be returned back to Halon and can be used with subsequent actuator requests. When SSPL receives that security token with some request, it will send that token with detail of action requested by Halon, to authentication server again. Authentication server will validate that token and authority of user for requested action. If token is valid and user is allowed for that action, it will send back a response to SSPL indicating that user is allowed to perform action. SSPL will then perform action and send response back to Halon.

validating access permissions, KVSNS checks if entry with the given file
name already exists by doing a lookup on parent. If entry does not exist,
it starts preparing for creating new entry for the inode. Finally, it
an object is created on the extstore.

.. _usecase.nfs.file.open:

nfs.file.open
-------------

Objective of KVSNS is to fill kvsns_fill_open structure which holds the information of
open flags, process id and thread id. When KVSNS receives open call it gets list of open
owners for that file. Once that is got, it updates the process id and thread id for the
current request and stores the list back to KV store. Finally, it updates the kvsns_fill_open
structure with necessary details and return it back to FSAL_KVSFS.

KVSNS receives the name of directory and parent inode number from the NFS server.
To check if user has appropriate access rights it will query KV store to get the
inode attributes of parent. After checking the access rights, KVSNS checks if entry
with the given file name already exists by doing a lookup on parent. If entry does
not exists it starts preparing for creating new entry. It creates an empty inode
structure and tries to fill in the details.

.. _usecase.sns.repreb:

sns.repreb
----------

Sns repair and rebalance are implemented as a mero services.
Halon triggers sns repair on drive failure and rebalance on drive replacement.
Repair and rebalance are distributed operations which are performed by every
node in parallel. Various resource contraints can be imposed on sns repair
and rebalance, e.g. memory, cpu or network bandwidth using resource manager.
Presently, only memory bandwidth constraints are imposed using buffer pool and
sliding window algorithm during sns repair and rebalance.

nodes work as NFS data servers and one of the nodes, takes up NFS metadata
server role. NFS metadata server node may optionally play NFS data server role
(provided the number of IO requests are controlled). NFS ganesha server stack
(user level implementation) is used, which will interface with Clovis which
in turn distributes the IO request to multiple MERO nodes.

.. image:: images/pNFS_Deployment.png

Shown below is the software components. NFS ganesha FSAL plugin named KVSFS
provides necessary hooks to plugin into NFS server implementation named KVSNS.
Data operations are redirected through abstraction layer EXT-STORE and metadata
(which uses Key-Value Store) through KVS-AL, which finally invokes corresponding
Clovis operations.

fdmi
----

File Data Manipulation Interface (fdmi) is a scalable `publish-subscribe
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern>`_ Mero
interface. fdmi is a part of Clovis [`clovis <entity.clovis_>`_] interface and allows extending
Mero without changes to the core Mero code. By using FDMI external applications
(called *fdmi plugins* [`fdmi.plugin <entity.fdmi.plugin_>`_] or *fdmi apps* [`fdmi.app <entity.fdmi.app_>`_]),
potentially created by 3rd parties, can provide new functionality without
affecting performance and consistency of the core system. These applications can
run on dedicated servers, thus achieving the goal of horizontal
scalability. Examples of fdmi plugins are:

    - asynchronous replication within a cluster or between clusters or to a
      non-Mero target;

    - backup, archive and other `ILM
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_lifecycle_management>`_
      applications;

    - hierarchical storage management;

    - tier-management (burst buffer prefetching and destaging), background
      compression, de-duplication;

    - online indexing;

    - compliance checking, logging, audit;

    - file system consistency checking.

.. image:: images/fdmi.dataflow.png

When a Mero instance executes a user request, it adds to its local fol [`fol <entity.fol_>`_]
a record with the details of the request. An fdmi plugin can define a *filter*
[`fdmi.filter <entity.fdmi.filter_>`_] that matches fol records of interest for the plugin by
inspecting their fields. A special fdmi service [`fdmi.service <entity.fdmi.service_>`_], running
within each Mero instance, matches each produced record against all filters and
sends the record to plugins with matching filters. The plugin receives all the
records, generated anywhere in the cluster matching its filters. This allows the
plugin to monitor certain aspects of the cluster activity and to react to them.

As a key element of mero scalability architecture, fdmi allows mero core to
remain simple, clear and focused, while providing a framework to support future
features and capabilities, in which they act as tightly integrated
components. Core mero will not have to change to add new features, such as
later-developed functionality to support HSM; instead, an fdmi plugin will be
written. The ability to utilize additional nodes to run fdmi plugins is
important for horizontal scalability and compares favorably with the traditional
architectures, where new features have to be added to existing servers.

fdmi vs. POSIX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a storage-level interface to data, fdmi overcomes the inherent limitations of
POSIX, by enabling plugins to directly manipulate the storage
infrastructure. This direct interaction allows storage applications to implement
changelogs, mirrors, snapshots, indexers and other complex data management
solutions.

As scale increases, ILM features (backup, migration, HSM, replication, etc.) hit
a POSIX "bottleneck". POSIX is designed for per-file lookups via string-based
hierarchical namespace traversals; this is an extremely inefficient method to
operate on an entire file system. POSIX forces inherently storage-centric
utilities like HSM, replication, backup, and search to use the same
stat/open/read/write/close interface to data as applications use, causing
generally poor performance, scalability, recovery, and administration. In other
words, the fdmi approach to publishing batched records to subscribed users is
singularly effective because no form of scanning works at exascale.

Another problem that emerges at scale is storage application behavior in the
face of failure, either in the storage system it operates upon or in the
application itself. To avoid arbitrary inconsistencies, scalable solutions to
ILM requirements must be tightly integrated with the storage system
implementation, in particular by relying on logging changes and transactional
mechanisms capable of resuming interrupted data management processes.

On a higher level, there is a striking contrast between the file system and
database worlds. In the latter, the domain-specific SQL language underlies most
applications, making them portable (either without or with a modest effort)
between various RDBMS systems. For file systems, the only common language is
POSIX and portable backup or HSM applications are unheard of (except for
POSIX-based solutions, such as tar and rsync, which are not scalable and
generally incorrect). The development of fdmi creates the possibility of an
entirely new market for portable storage applications that are designed and
developed independently from storage systems. To this end, fdmi is portable and
can be implemented on non-Mero systems.

sources post records [`fdmi.record <entity.fdmi.record_>`_] to the service. The service matches
records against the filters. If a record matches a filter, the record is sent to
the plugin, which registered the filter. A record can match multiple filters and
can be sent to multiple plugins. Records are sent to plugins in batches
[`fdmi.batch <entity.fdmi.batch_>`_] to amortise the cost of network communication at the cost of
increased latency.

The service controls life time of the records, assuring that they exist until
processed by the plugin.

fdmi service [`fdmi.service <entity.fdmi.service_>`_] and is used by them to select which records
should be sent to the plugin, i.e., which records the plugin has subscribed to.

A plugin can create and register multiple filters. Filters are stored
persistently in a special index, used internally by the fdmi implementation.

fdmi.plugin
-----------

An fdmi plugin is an application [`application <entity.application_>`_] that uses fdmi [`fdmi <entity.fdmi_>`_]
part of clovis [`clovis <entity.clovis_>`_] interface. Typically, a plugin would be an
executable, linked with the mero library and running on a dedicated node (i.e.,
not on one of the nodes where mero core services [`service <entity.service_>`_] are running), but
there is no technical restriction on where the fdmi interface is invoked: a
plugin can at the same time be a mero client [`mero.client <entity.mero.client_>`_], a front-end
application and so on.

A plugin constructs one or more filters [`fdmi.filter <entity.fdmi.filter_>`_] to monitor some
aspects of activity in the cluster. fdmi asynchronously delivers to the plugin
all published records [`fdmi.record <entity.fdmi.record_>`_] matching any of the filters and the
plugin can act on the records in any way.

A simplest plugin would just analyse the records for the purposes of
accumulating some statistics and producing reports.

More complex plugins could execute operations in the cluster (or outside of the
cluster) based on the received records. For example, re-executing received
records in a different cluster would result in a simple replication mechanism.

service adds the record to the batch for this plugin. When the batch grows
larger than certain size, or is not sent longer than certain internal of time,
it is sent to the plugin and emptied. Batches are the method to achieve
scalability of fdmi publish-subscribe interface by reducing the overhead of
individual record delivery at the expense of increased delivery latency.

-----------

Compute the checksum for each unit of data and send it to the receiver
before the data, so that checksum can be verified and network
corruption can be detected. Similarly also store checksum for each
unit as part of AD meta-data, which can be verified during read
operation.

-------------------

During put Key value operation, if the keys may get changed due to
some network or memory corruption then records are stored in some
different location. It may corrupt the the records already present. So
every put opration should check the sanity of keys using checksum or
protection tag.

IO service is a mero service which cater READ/WRITE object data operations. It
also services COB meta-data operations like CREATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, GETATTR,
and SETATTR. IO service use RDMA to copy data from/to client with the help of
pre-allocated and pre-registred memory buffers which registered with RDMA hardware.

Meta-data back-end (BE) is a module presenting an interface for a transactional
local meta-data storage. BE users manipulate and access meta-data structures in
memory. BE maps this memory to persistent storage. User groups meta-data updates
in transactions [`be.tx <entity.be.tx_>`_]. BE guarantees that transactions are atomic in the
face of process failures. BE provides support for a few frequently used
data-structures: double linked list [`be.list <entity.be.list_>`_], B-tree [`be.btree <entity.be.btree_>`_] and
extmap [`BE.extmap <entity.BE.extmap_>`_].

.. _entity.be.tx:

be.tx
-----

A transaction is a collection of updates. User adds an update to a transaction
by capturing the update region [`be.reg <entity.be.reg_>`_]. User explicitly closes a
transaction. BE guarantees that a closed transaction is atomic with respect to
process crashes that happen after transaction close call returns. That is,
after such a crash, either all or none of transaction updates will be present
in the segment [`be.seg <entity.be.seg_>`_] memory when the segment is opened next time. If a
process crashes before a transaction closes, BE guarantees that none of
transaction updates will be present in the segment memory (see BE recovery
[`be.recovery <entity.be.recovery_>`_]).

.. _entity.be.tx.payload:

be.tx.payload
-------------

A memory buffer associated with the transaction [`be.tx <entity.be.tx_>`_]. It's supposed to
be filled by the user. The payload is available to the user during the BE
recovery [`be.recovery <entity.be.recovery_>`_].

.. _entity.be.credit:

be.credit
---------

A credit is a measure of a group of updates. A credit is a pair (nr, size),
where nr is the number of updates and size is total size in bytes of modified
regions.

.. _entity.be.seg:

be.seg
------

A segment is a stob [`stob <entity.stob_>`_] mapped to an extent in process address space. Each address
in the extent uniquely corresponds to the offset in the stob and vice versa.
Stob is divided into blocks of fixed size. Memory extent is divided into pages
of fixed size. Page size is a multiple of block size (it follows that stob size
is a multiple of page size). At a given moment in time, some pages are
up-to-date (their contents is the same as of the corresponding stob blocks) and
some are dirty (their contents was modified relative to the stob blocks). In
the initial implementation all pages are up-to-date, when the segment is
opened. In the later versions, pages will be loaded dynamically on demand. The
memory extent to which a segment is mapped is called segment memory;

.. _entity.be.reg:

be.reg
------

A region is an extent within segment memory.  A (meta-data) update is a
modification of some region;

to the log [`be.log <entity.be.log_>`_] and recovered [`be.recovery <entity.be.recovery_>`_] together.

.. _entity.be.list:

be.list
-------

Persistent intrusive double-linked list. The ambient objects should be stored
in BE segment [`be.seg <entity.be.seg_>`_].

.. _entity.be.allocator:

be.allocator
------------

Allocator provides API to allocate and free memory in BE segment [`be.seg <entity.be.seg_>`_].
Memory is allocated from the segment using first-fit algorithm. The allocator
data structures are based on BE list [`be.list <entity.be.list_>`_].

.. _entity.be.alloc.oom:

be.alloc.oom
------------

A situation that happens when there is no free space in BE segment [`be.seg <entity.be.seg_>`_]
left that has the required size and alignment. In this case the allocator
[`be.allocator <entity.be.allocator_>`_] returns NULL as a pointer and -ENOMEM as the return code.
The error handling in this case is totally on the user of the allocator.

.. _entity.be.btree:

be.btree
--------

B-tree is a persistent data structure that resides inside
[`be.segment <entity.be.segment_>`_]. It provides Key-Value store asynchronous interface
to the user. B-trees are commonly used in storage systems which employ
their special locality pattern to access keys and values that can be
stored and loaded from disk in efficient manner. Typical operations
over B-tree which user can execute are: create tree, delete tree,
insert (key, val), delete (key), update (key, val), lookup (key).

.. _entity.be.extmap:

be.extmap
---------

Extent map is a persistent transactional collection of extents in an abstract
numerical name-space with a numerical value associated to each extent. It's
built on top of BE btree [`be.btree <entity.be.btree_>`_].

.. _entity.be.paged:

be.paged
--------

PageD is a cache manager for segment stob I/O. It‚Äôs designed to add a
support of big segments into BE as far as we can‚Äôt keep all segments
in memory because total size of segments may exceed virtual memory
space; it‚Äôs also can be used to optimize segment stob writes.

.. _entity.be.paged.page:

be.paged.page
-------------

Page is a memory space from (start address to start address + page
size) corresponding to data, stored inside BE segment at given offset
and page size. One can imagine a page as an in-memory read cache of
the given ‚Äúextent‚Äù inside segment.

.. _entity.be.paged.cellar:

be.paged.cellar
---------------

Cellar page looks like a page, containing closed be.tx
updates. Represents a write cache of pages from (start address to
start address + page size) written into be.segment at given offset and
page size.

.. _entity.be.paged.request:

be.paged.request
----------------

PageD request is a set of page references, flags and synchronization
objects used to be processed inside PageD FOM tick(). Encapsulates
methods to notify caller of this request that it‚Äôs finished.

.. _entity.be.paged.fom:

be.paged.fom
------------

PageD FOM is a long-living specific FOM which is used to process
requests sent by the user to PageD.  It's woken up when PageD request
occurs. PageD processes requests according to their type which can be
READ, WRITE, MANAGE.

.. _entity.be.io:

be.io
-----

m0_be_io is an abstraction on top of m0_stob_io [`stob.io <entity.stob.io_>`_]. It makes all kinds
of stob I/O inside BE easier.

BE io is used by BE log [`be.log <entity.be.log_>`_] and BE paged [`be.paged <entity.be.paged_>`_] for the
segment [`be.seg <entity.be.seg_>`_] I/O.

.. _entity.be.log:

be.log
------

BE [`be <entity.be_>`_] uses write-ahead logging. Log is used as a place to write information about
transactions [`be.tx <entity.be.tx_>`_] to make the transactions recoverable [`be.recovery <entity.be.recovery_>`_].

.. _entity.be.recovery:

be.recovery
-----------

BE [`be <entity.be_>`_] allows users to modify segments [`be.seg <entity.be.seg_>`_] in transactional
[`be.tx <entity.be.tx_>`_] way. A segment is backed with a linux stob [`stob.linux <entity.stob.linux_>`_], which
doesn't provide atomic writes. BE should have consistent segments even after
crash. Therefore BE should have a part that can recover BE segments data after
crash. This part is called BE recovery.

The recovery algorithm applies to the BE segment all transactions that are
stored in the log [`be.log <entity.be.log_>`_] but are not completely written to the BE
segment.

.. _entity.stob:

stob
----

Storage object is a fundamental abstraction of M0. Storage objects offer a
linear address space for data and may have redundancy and may have integrity
data.

There are multiple types of storage objects, used for various purposes and
providing various extensions of the basic storage object interface described
below. Specifically, containers for data and meta-data are implemented as
special types of storage objects.

.. _entity.stob.linux:

stob.linux
----------

Implementation of m0_stob on top of Linux files.

A linux storage object is simply a file on a local file system. A linux storage
object domain is a directory containing a directory where files, corresponding
to storage objects are stored in. A name of a file is built from the
corresponding storage object local identifier (m0_stob_id).

A linux storage object domain is identified by the path to its directory.

When an in-memory representation for an object is created, no file system
operations are performed. It is only when the object is "located"
(m0_stob_locate()) or "created" (m0_stob_create()) when actual open(2)
system call is made. If the call was successful, the file descriptor
(m0_stob_linux::sl_fd) remains open until the object is destroyed.

stob.io
-------

Asynchronous Direct Io Extensible User interface (adieu) for storage objects.

adieu is an interface for a non-blocking (asynchronous) 0-copy (direct)
vectored IO against storage objects.

A user of this interface builds an IO operation description and queues it
against a storage object. IO completion or failure notification is done by
signalling a user supplied m0_chan. As usual, the user can either wait on the
chan or register a call-back with it.

adieu supports scatter-gather type of IO operations (that is, vectored on both
input and output data).

adieu can work both on local and remote storage objects. adieu IO operations
are executed as part of a distributed transaction.

Once a S3 bucket is created its name cannot be changed. Below are the rules for naming S3 bucket
in all regions.

  - Bucket names must be unique across all existing bucket names in S3
  - Bucket names must comply with DNS naming conventions.
  - Bucket names must be at least 3 and no more than 63 characters long.
  - Bucket names must not contain uppercase characters or underscores.
  - Bucket names must start with a lowercase letter or number.
  - Bucket names must be a series of one or more labels. Adjacent labels are separated by a single period (.). Bucket names can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Each label must start and end with a lowercase letter or a number.
  - Bucket names must not be formatted as an IP address (for example, 192.178.62.32).
  - In case of virtual hosted‚Äìstyle buckets with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the SSL wildcard certificate only matches buckets that don't contain periods. To work around this, use HTTP or write your own certificate verification logic. Its recommended that we do not use periods (".") in bucket names when using virtual hosted‚Äìstyle buckets.

.. _entity.s3.object:

.. _entity.rpc:

rpc
---

RPC is a high level part of Mero network stack. It contains operations allowing
user to send [`rpc.item <entity.rpc.item_>`_]s, containing file operation packets (FOP) to network
destinations. RPC layer speaks about FOPs being sent from and to end-points and
RPCs, which are containers for FOPs, being sent to services.  RPC is a part of a
Mero serivices as well as a Mero clients.

.. _entity.rpc.item:

rpc.item
--------

RPC item is a portion of information sent over RPC. Typicaly FOPs aggregate such
items inside itself, which allows them to be sent over the network.

.. _entity.rpc.connection:

rpc.connection
--------------

RPC connection is a container of session. Typically, user can create several
sessions commint onto the same end-point for its needs.

.. _entity.rpc.session:

rpc.session
-----------

RPC session is a long-lived Mero service object. Clients may establish sessions,
FOPs are sent over these sessions to the server side. Sender may also terminate
sessions and check out whether it's failed.

.. _entity.rpc.formation:

rpc.formation
-------------

Formation algorithm acts on a cache of RPC items. It decides the items to be
selected from the cache and it puts them together in an RPC object. The
formation algorithm makes sure that maximum size of an RPC object is limited so
that it makes optimal use of network bandwidth

.. _entity.rpc.timeout:

rpc.timeout
-----------

RPC timeout controls how long data sent over RPC connection may remain
unacknowledged by the client or server side before a connection is forcefully
moved to terminated or failed state.

When rpc item reply is not received within a timeout, then rpc item is
marked as failed with timeout.

.. _entity.rpc.resend:

dynamically changes configuration or loses connection to some of confd servers.

.. _entity.fop:

fop
---

FOP, file operation packet, a description of file operation suitable for sending
over network and storing on a storage device. File operation packet (FOP)
identifies file operation type and operation parameters.

.. _entity.fop.entrypoint:

fop.entrypoint
--------------

The entrypoint fop.

When a new process wants to join the cluster it sends so-called entrypoint fop
to Halon [`halon <entity.halon_>`_]. The fop contains information about the process. Then
Halon decides what to do with the process (allow it to join or not, for
example), and then sends entrypoint reply fop with all the information needed
to work in the cluster. This includes, among other things, the active RM
[`rm.active <entity.rm.active_>`_] and the list of confds [`confd <entity.confd_>`_] from which the process can
get the cluster configuration [`conf <entity.conf_>`_].

.. _entity.confd.quorum:

confd.quorum
------------

After the entrypoint reply fop [`fop.entrypoint <entity.fop.entrypoint_>`_] is received rconfc
[`rconfc <entity.rconfc_>`_] queries the version of configuration on every confd [`confd <entity.confd_>`_]

.. _entity.bitrot:

bitrot
------

This is the case when the data on drive gets corrupted due to some bit flip
and subsequent read on that data fails the checksum verification. This is
handled by triggering a background scrub [`durability.bitrot <entity.durability.bitrot_>`_] operation.

.. _entity.bitrot.md:

bitrot.md
---------

A bit rot case [`bitrot <entity.bitrot_>`_] when the metadata becomes corrupted due to a bit
rot. It's supposed to be detected with checksums in every BE object
[`be.obj <entity.be.obj_>`_]. The only solution we have now to handle the metadata bit rot is
to consider all segments in this drive as lost and then repair all the missing
data using SNS rebalace [`sns.rebalance <entity.sns.rebalance_>`_] or SNS direct rebalance
[`sns.rebalance.direct <entity.sns.rebalance.direct_>`_] for data and DIX rebalance [`dix.rebalance <entity.dix.rebalance_>`_] or
DIX direct rebalance [`dix.rebalance.direct <entity.dix.rebalance.direct_>`_] for the missing distributed
indexes [`dix <entity.dix_>`_].

.. _entity.fop.cob.check:

fop.cob.check
-------------

A fop to verify DI checksum [`checksum <entity.checksum_>`_].

The DI mismatch can happen during the BSC scan [`bsc.scan <entity.bsc.scan_>`_] or read I/O from
Clovis [`clovis <entity.clovis_>`_]. This fop can trigger DI checksum verification for a
particular offset within a particular cob (this includes data, parity and spare
units) without returning data back to the Clovis application. If the DI
checksum mismatch is detected the unit is handled in the same way as if it was
detected by read I/O or BSC scan.

.. _entity.bsc:

bsc
---

Background is a mero service that detects as well as repairs the corrupted data
block. Background scrub can be triggered in case of checksum mismatch during a
typical read io or by the background scrub [`bsc.scanner <entity.bsc.scanner_>`_].

.. _entity.bsc.scanner:

bsc.scanner
-----------

Background scrub scanner is a part of the background scrub service and iterates over
allocated mero data block space ([`balloc <component.balloc_>`_]) to detect any corruption using the
[`di <entity.di_>`_] interface. On detecting the corruption, scanner submits a
[`bsc.repair.request <entity.bsc.repair.request_>`_].

.. _entity.bsc.repair.request:

bsc.repair.request
------------------

A background scrub repair request can be submitted to background scrub
([`durability.bitrot <entity.durability.bitrot_>`_]) in context of a read i/o or by the background scrub scanner.

.. _entity.bsc.bad.list:

bsc.bad.list
------------

We can encounter DI [`checksum <entity.checksum_>`_] data mismatch for a data/parity/spare unit. It's
known that such units doesn't have the right data, but they may still have at
least parts of the data. The BSC bad list contains all the units with the DI
checksum that doesn't match the data along with the connections to the files
the units are the part of. This way the system administrator still can recover
whatever is left from such units. It's also possible that the bit rot is
transient, i.e. next read would return the data that matches the DI checksum,
so it also should be possible to do something about it.

The bad list comes with the list management capability, like enumerating all
the failed units with their files, removing the "DI has failed" flags,
re-checking the failed units to see if the DI mismatch persists etc.

.. _entity.bsc.request.list:

bsc.request.list
----------------

Background scrub persists the in-progress scrub requests list in [`be <entity.be_>`_] in-order
to continue the operation post node restart.

.. _entity.bsc.scrubber:

bsc.scrubber
------------

Scrubber processes the [`bsc.repair.request <entity.bsc.repair.request_>`_] using the mero fom infrastructure.

.. _entity.balance.capacity:

balance.capacity
----------------

Balance capacity runs as a mero service on every mero node. Every participating mero node is
elected as a co-ordinator in turns. Every co-ordinator completes its part of balancing and hands
over control back to halon, which in turn elects the next co-ordinator. Halon provides required
policy support to the participating nodes to identify if a particular file needs balancing or
not.

---------------------

On pool modification, i.e. on addition of some new hardware to the pool, based on some
policy, halon triggers a capacity balance operation on the modified pool.

.. _entity.balance.capacity.policy:

balance.capacity.policy
-----------------------

This is the capacity balance policy configured at Halon in-order to decided the following,
- when to start balance capacity operation,
- when to stop balance capacity operation,
- if a particular file needs balancing or not.

----------------------

This is about balancing the [`dix.index <entity.dix.index_>`_] metadata across the storage.

.. _entity.balance.restripe:

balance.capacity.restripe
-------------------------

During balance capacity, it is possible that the existing data may have to be restriped,
e.g. the if initial data was striped using 8 + 2 layout, it may have to striped using
16 + 4.

.. _entity.balance.coordinator:

balance.capacity.coordinator
----------------------------

Balance capacity coordinator is selected by Halon before starting the balance operation.
Coordinator is the one who drives the balance operation. Every node acts as a coordinator
in a sequential manner. Coordinator pull the relevant data from relevant nodes and
redirects it to its new location.

.. _entity.balance.layout.set:

---------------------------

Balancing operation also changes a file's layout which is updated after the file is completely
balanced. File layout will be changed using dtm0.

.. _entity.balance.capacity.bsc.request:

balance.capacity.bsc.request
----------------------------

If balance capacity io operation encounters a data or metadata corruption, it submits a background
scrub ([`bsc <entity.bsc_>`_]) request for the corrupted data in context of that io.

.. _entity.balance.capacity.rm:

balance.capacity.rm
-------------------

Balance capacity uses file locks implemented as a resource, managed by resource manager,
to handle concurrent io.

.. _entity.balance.capacity.bufferpool:

balance.capacity.bufferpool
---------------------------

Balance capacity uses buffer pools to read and write data. Buffer pool size can be tuned
in-order to impose any memory bandwidth constraints on balance capacity operation.

.. _entity.balance.capacity.dtm0:

balance.capacity.dtm0
---------------------

Meta data update failures during balance capacity operations make use of DTM0. Pending
transactions are redone by dtm0.

.. _entity.balance.capacity.cob.versioning:

balance.capacity.cob.versioning
-------------------------------

Version attribute is added to cob on its creation. During balance operation, the old
cob is mantained until the data is relocated and the corresponding metadata is
successfully updated in DIX. The old cob is cleanedup after the metadata update.
Any failure during the metadata update is handled with the help of dtm0.

.. _entity.balance.capacity.flowcontrol:

balance.capacity.flowcontrol
----------------------------

Balance capacity operation flow can be controlled using various resource manager constraints
like memory, network, cpu, etc. For example, memory constraints can be applied through buffer
pools.

.. _entity.balance.capacity.evacuate:

balance.capacity.evacuate
-------------------------

Balancing can also be required in case the storage capacity is reduced.


.. _entity.pdclust:

pdclust
-------

Mero uses parity declustered layout for storing objects. Mero's implementation of pdclust layout
has two advantages:
	-Formulaic layout: object offset is translated to disk and disk offset using a formula,
         hence a lookup table is not needed.
	-Improved IO and recovery performance.
Under this layout every object is divided into chunks known as [`pdclust.unit <entity.pdclust.unit_>`_] and parity
is calculated for collection of such units. Such a collection is known as a parity group. Number of
parities to be calculated per parity group is configurable. Eg. If
object size is 65 MB, and unit size is 1 MB. Then a possible way is to form 9 parity groups,
each consisting of 8 units, and say 3 parity units per group (3 parities calculated over 8 units).

.. _entity.pdclust.unit:

pdclust.unit
------------

Data of an object is divided into fixed sized chunks known as units..

.. _entity.pdclust.paritygroup:

pdclust.paritygroup
-------------------

A parity group is a collection of [`pdclust.unit <entity.pdclust.unit_>`_]s along with a set of parities calculated over them. It also includes
spare units (to which repaired units from a parity group go).

.. _entity.pdclust.target:

pdclust.target
--------------

Target stores the unit of a parity group into a [`pdclust.targetframe <entity.pdclust.targetframe_>`_].

.. _entity.pdclust.targetframe:

pdclust.targetframe
-------------------

Target frame represents a basic storage block in a logical storage space associated with an object on a given target.
Frame size is same as the unit size associated with an object.


.. _entity.failuredomain:

failuredomain
-------------

Any hardware resource or collection of thereof, failure of which can potentially cause a loss
of object data is called as a failure domain. The typical set of failure domains
includes (but is not limited to):

	- site;
	- rack;
	- enclosure;
	- controller;
	- disk.

.. _entity.failuredomain.tree:

failuredomain.tree
------------------

A hierarchial topology in which various [`failuredomain <entity.failuredomain_>`_] are arranged is
known as a failure domains tree. With every [`pool.pver <entity.pool.pver_>`_] there are associated
a collection of failure domains trees.

.. _entity.pool:

pool
----

A pool provides an abstraction for collection of configuration objects that can
potentially be used to store Mero objects.
These objects form a tree hierarchy of which a pool is the root node.

.. _entity.pool.pver:

pool.pver
---------

A pool version is a subtree of a pool [`pool <entity.pool_>`_]. The layout of an object gets
associated with a pool version. Multiple pool versions (possibly with
overlapping subtrees) can be formed over a given pool.  A pool version can have
a presence either in memory or in configuration database or at both places. Mero
has three types of pool versions:
	- [`pool.pver.actual <entity.pool.pver.actual_>`_];
	- [`pool.pver.formulaic <entity.pool.pver.formulaic_>`_];
	- [`pool.pver.virtual <entity.pool.pver.virtual_>`_];

	Relation in formulaic and virtual pool versions.

.. _entity.pool.pver.actual:

pool.pver.actual
----------------

An actual pool version is also known as a base pool version. All the configuration objects that constitute an
actual pool version are known at the time of Mero bootstrap and hence an actual pool version is present in
persistent configuration schema.

.. _entity.pool.pver.formulaic:

pool.pver.formulaic
-------------------

A formulaic pool version is present in conf DB and is always associated with one
of the actual pool versions [`pool.pver.actual <entity.pool.pver.actual_>`_].  It only indicates how many
failures at various levels of actual pool version can be allowed to create new
pool versions that would skip the failed objects.

.. _entity.pool.pver.virtual:

pool.pver.virtual
-----------------

A virtual pool version is an instance of formulaic pool version
[`pool.pver.formulaic <entity.pool.pver.formulaic_>`_] and hence is always associated with an actual pool
version [`pool.pver.actual <entity.pool.pver.actual_>`_] and a set of failed configuration objects. An in
memory instance of a virtual pool version gets created only when it needs to be
associated with an object.

.. _entity.pool.pver.allowancevector:

pool.pver.allowancevector
-------------------------

An allowance vector associated with a pool version [`pool.pver <entity.pool.pver_>`_] has dimension
same as the height of pool version tree and each level of it indicates the
allowed number of failures at that level in pool version tree that can be
accommodated to create a formulaic pool version [`pool.pver.formulaic <entity.pool.pver.formulaic_>`_].

.. _entity.pool.pver.tolerancevector:

pool.pver.tolerancevector
-------------------------

A tolerance vector associated with a pool version [`pool.pver <entity.pool.pver_>`_] has dimension
same as the height of pool version tree, and it indicates the number of failures
that can be tolerated for reading an object, at each level of the tree.

.. _entity.pool.pver.pooldev:

pool.pver.pooldev
-----------------

In memory representation for a storage device used by pools component.

.. _entity.pool.pver.poolmachine:

pool.pver.poolmachine
---------------------

An abstraction for the collection of pooldevs [`pool.pver.pooldev <entity.pool.pver.pooldev_>`_] present in
a pool version.

.. _entity.pool.pver.selectionpolicy:

pool.pver.selectionpolicy
-------------------------

A pool version [`pool.pver <entity.pool.pver_>`_] can be constructed out of a pool [`pool <entity.pool_>`_] using
different policies. E.g., removing failed devices or removing most populated
devices, or removing devices with most bad blocks (as perceived by Mero)
etc. Pool versions are searched as per policy defined with pool while `create
object [`clovis.multi-site.create <usecase.clovis.multi-site.create_>`_] operation.

.. _entity.pool.pver.poolmachine.poolmachinestate:

pool.pver.poolmachine.poolmachinestate
--------------------------------------

The state of devices that are part of a pool machine [`pool.pver.poolmachine <entity.pool.pver.poolmachine_>`_] indicates the availability of device.
The possible states are:
:: M0_PNDS_UNKNOWN, M0_PNDS_ONLINE, M0_PNDS_FAILED, M0_PNDS_OFFLINE,
	M0_PNDS_SNS_REPAIRING, M0_PNDS_SNS_REPAIRED

specification.

Inspections can be internal (done by the dld authors) or external. An inspection
starts with the formal checks including:

    - conformance to the dld style guide;

    - dld must include the list of use cases and the list should be complete;

    - dld must describe all the data-structures introduced and their invariants;

    - dld must describe concurrency control policies, including:

      + locks, description of data-structures and invariants protected by the locks;

      + lock ordering;

      + wait channels and condition variables;

      + concurrency assumptions;

    - memory management and ownership of allocated objects;

    - interfaces and their implementations, including pre- and post- conditions
      of all functions;

    - liveness of data structures and allocated memory;

    - description of possible failures and their handling.

.. _entity.clovis:

clovis
------

clovis (not an acronym) is the external interface that Mero provides to
applications. It replaces the traditional file-system access interfaces and
protocols (posix, nfs, cifs, etc.) as well as proprietary control
interfaces. The clovis interface consists of sub-interfaces:

    - clovis access sub-interface that provides basic storage abstractions: data
      object, key-value index, transaction, operation;

    - clovis extension sub-interface that provides access to the fdmi
      sub-system;

    - clovis management sub-interface that provides features for system
      configuration, deployment, monitoring and analysis.

The goals of the clovis interface design are:

    - scalable

      + no central meta-data,
      + tunable consistency guarantees,
      + aggregation, containers;

    - complete

      + storage access,
      + management,
      + monitoring;

    - portable

      + not tied to POSIX,
      + user space and kernel;

    - flexible;
    - no fixed meta-data scheme;
    - extensibility, plugins;
    - re-usable concepts;
    - trusted users can extend system: layouts, resources;
    - simple security mechanism: capabilities

There are several typical clovis use cases:

    - in the simplest case, an application uses only access interface. Storage
      objects are used to keep data and key-value indices for meta-data,
      effectively using Mero as a scalable transactional object store;

    - alternatively, a special front-end application can use clovis to implement
      a ‚Äústandard‚Äù interface, like posix, hdf5 or s3, enabling existing
      applications to run on top of Mero;

    - by using clovis extension interface, an application can extend core Mero
      functionality and add more features without modifying core code or
      hampering scalability.

.. _entity.clovis.entity:

clovis.entity
-------------

clovis objects [`clovis.object <entity.clovis.object_>`_], indices [`clovis.index <entity.clovis.index_>`_] and containers
[`clovis.container <entity.clovis.container_>`_] are collectively known as clovis *entities*. An entity is
uniquely identified by a cluster-wide never reused identifier called fid
[`fid <entity.fid_>`_], selected by the user when the entity is created. A fid is 128-bits
wide with 8 most significant bits identifying the entity type. mero provides a
fid allocator [`fid.allocator <entity.fid.allocator_>`_] interface to generate unique fids.

clovis provides bulk operations on entities, which is an ability to invoke a
specified server-side function with contents of an entity as parameters:

    - for an object this means invoking the function with object data-blocks as
      input parameters;

    - for an index this means invoking the function with index key-value records
      as parameters;

    - for a container this means invoking the function with the fid of each
      container element as a parameter.

.. _entity.clovis.object:

clovis.object
-------------

A (data) object is used to store large amounts of data. An object is an array of
fixed size blocks (block size specified at object creation time), indexed by
64-bit integers. Data, stored in the object, can be read or overwritten at the
block granularity. Contrary to more traditional object stores and file system,
an object has no attributes associated with it, except for an 128-bit
identifier, selected by the application when the object is created. By design,
all meta-data, if any, associated with the object must be stored separately in
the key-value indices [`clovis.index <entity.clovis.index_>`_]. Instead of per-object attributes, an
object has block attributes (**not currently implemented**), associated with
every block. Such block attributes are used by application to store meta-data
required in data IO path, for example, data integrity check-sums, or
cryptographic attributes. Storing such per-block meta-data attributes in a
key-value index would incur a cost of separate network round-trip in every IO
operation. Mero stores attributes together with its internal meta-data, which is
accessed to locate the data blocks, thus avoiding an extra cost of attribute
lookup. Data IO to an object is fully vectored: data transfer (read or write) is
done between a sequence of application-provided buffers and a sequence of block
extents within the object. IO semantics is deliberately weak. The implementation
has complete freedom is executing actual in any order without ordering
guarantees in case of failure halfway through the operation.  Additional
operations are provided to pre-allocate particular data-blocks and free
allocated data-blocks.

.. _entity.clovis.index:

clovis.index
------------

A key-value index is used to store meta-data and small amounts of data (in the
sense that it is more efficient to use objects [`clovis.object <entity.clovis.object_>`_] to store
large amounts of data). An index stores records, where a record is a key-value
pair. Indices have a fairly standard repertoire of operations to insert, delete,
lookup and iterate records. The interface is fully vectored (multiple records
can be updated or queried at once). An application can create an arbitrary
number of indices, each named by a 128-bit identifier, assigned by the
application. As in case of objects, an index has no application-visible
attributes.

The plural of "index" is "indices".

.. _entity.copymachine:

copymachine
-----------

Copymachine is a generic state machine based framework that can be used to implement a distributed operation
like sns repair and rebalance. It provides some common functionality that can be used by specific operations,
e.g. resource throttling and state persistence.

.. _entity.copymachine.pump:

copymachine.pump
----------------

Copymachine pump is an entity that is part of generic copy machine framework. Copy machine pump is
implemented using mero fom infrastructure. Copy machine pump creates copy packets ([`copymachine.copypacket <entity.copymachine.copypacket_>`_])
and invokes the operation (e.g. repair/rebalance) specific data iterator to populate the copy packet.

.. _entity.copymachine.aggregation.group:

copymachine.aggregation.group
-----------------------------

Aggregation group represents a collection of copy packets that share the common properties, e.g. a parity
group.

.. _entity.copymachin.copypacket:

copymachine.copypacket
----------------------

Copymachine copypacket is part of the generic copy machine framework and has some common information that can
be used by the specific operations. Specific operation like sns repair or rebalance can inherit from this
generic copymachine copypacket and have their own specific information augmented to it.

.. _entity.copymachine.proxy:

copymachine.proxy
-----------------

Copymachine proxy represents a remote copymachine on another node in cluster. It is an entity in proxy
protocol and is used to implement the sliding window protocol. A typical copy machine proxy maintains
the state and progress of remote copymachine. Proxy protocol can be used to notify about the failure
of a remote copy machine to others participating in the distributed operation.

.. _entity.copymachine.proxy.update:

copymachine.proxy.update
------------------------

As the state of copymachine changes the peer copymachines are updated through the proxy protocol
via the corressponding proxies.

.. _entity.copymachine.sliding.window:

copymachine.sliding.window
--------------------------

Various resource constraints can be imposed using sliding window. Presently for sns repair and rebalance,
the memory constraints are imposed using buffer pool. So, sender and receiver of the data create data
packets ([`copymachine.copypacket <entity.copymachine.copypacket_>`_]) only if the required space is available in the relevant buffer
pools. As the copy packets are created, which are typically part of an aggregation group
([`copymachine.aggregation.group <entity.copymachine.aggregation.group_>`_]), the corresponding aggregation group is added to the sliding window.
The update to the sliding window is then notified to the copy machine peers and the sender can then send
and receiver can receive the data accordingly.

.. uml::

   participant sender
   participant sendRecvProxy
   participant bufferPoolOut
   participant bufferPoolIn
   participant receiver
   participant recvSendProxy

   sender <-> bufferPoolOut: has space Yes/No
   sender -> sender: outgoing aggregation group create
   receiver <-> bufferPoolIn: has space Yes/No
   receiver -> receiver: incoming aggregation group create

   rr2 -> H: reply start success/failure

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.copypacket:

copymachine.sns.repreb.copypacket
---------------------------------

Sns copy machines (repair and rebalance) inherit and augment generic copy packet which is used to carry
data from storage to some peer copymachine.

of sns copy packet fom through which the io is performed.

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.xform:

copymachine.sns.repreb.xform
----------------------------

After reading data sns repair performs certain tranformations on relevant data in-order to recover the missing
data.

.. _entity,copymachine.sns.repreb.net:

copymachine.sns.repreb.net
--------------------------

Every sns repair/rebalance after transforming its local data to partially recover the missing data, the
recovered piece of missing data is sent to its relevant destination.

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.halon:

copymachine.sns.repreb.halon
----------------------------

Halon is responsible to send appropriate commands to the sns repair/rebalance services in the cluster,
which comprises of start, quiesce, resume, abort and status of sns repair/rebalance operation.

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.layout:

copymachine.sns.repreb.layout
-----------------------------

during a recovery operation.

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.paritymath:

copymachine.sns.repreb.paritymath
---------------------------------

Sns parity math module provides the data transformation assistence during sns repair operation.

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.bufferpool:

copymachine.sns.repreb.bufferpool
---------------------------------

Sns repair/rebalance provisions a fixed size on incoming and outgoing bufferpool when the operation
starts. The buffers required for io and transformations are provided though these 2 bufferpool.
They also help in imposing memory bandwidth contraints on the repair/rebalance operations.

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.be:

copymachine.sns.repreb.be
-------------------------

Sns repair/rebalance uses mero backend (be) to persist the progress of the operation, mainly the
last aggregation group ([`copymachine.sns.repreb.aggregation.group <entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.aggregation.group_>`_]) successfully processed.

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.di:

copymachine.sns.repreb.di
-------------------------

Sns repair/rebalance uses mero di to read and write checksums during io operations. On checksum
mismatch, a background scrub request is submitted to repair the relevant corrupted data block.
It is possible that the drive failure is reported in subsequent io failures.

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.bsc:

copymachine.sns.repreb.bsc
--------------------------

Background scrub request is submitted in case of checksum mismatch during sns read operation.
Repair will wait until the relevant block is repaired or marked as permanently failed.

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.ccio:

copymachine.sns.repreb.ccio
---------------------------

Concurrent io is supported during sns repair/rebalance operations. Sns uses proxy protocol,
support from mero stob layer or file locks inorder to maintain operational consistency.

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.rm:

copymachine.sns.repreb.rm
-------------------------

It is possible that sns uses file locks managed my mero resource manager (rm) inorder to
maintain operational consistency during concurrent io.

.. _entity.copymachine.sns.repreb.pause.resume:

copymachine.sns.repreb.pause.resume
-----------------------------------

Sns repair/rebalance operation can be paused and resumed by halon due to various reasons,
transient device failure during the operation, for instance.

metadata.internal.sns
---------------------

Any corruption to internal metadata is treated as metadata drive failure and may trigger direct sns
rebalance.

.. _entity.metadata.internal.be.checksum:

metadata.internal.be.checksum
-----------------------------

Mero backend ([`be <entity.be_>`_]) maintains internal checksum per be extent or segment in-order to detect
metadata bitrot.

.. _entity.metadata.external.s3:

metadata.external.s3
--------------------

External metadata is typically the application specific metadata that is stored in Mero.
S3 is one of the applications that uses mero distributed key value store ([`mero.dix <component.mero.dix_>`_]). This
interface can be accesed using clovis C-API.

.. _entity.metadata.external.clovis:

metadata.external.clovis
------------------------

Clovis is the mero C-API that provides interfaces to access the external metadata.

.. _entity.metadata.external.be.checksum:

metadata.external.be.checksum
-----------------------------

Mero backend ([`be <entity.be_>`_]) maintains internal checksum per be extent or may be for overall be segment.
This checksum can be used to detect bitrot in eaternal metadata. In case of bitrot, direct dix
rebalance is triggered.

.. _entity.metadata.external.bitrot:

metadata.external.bitrot
------------------------------------

Bitrot in external metadata is handled by starting DIX ([`mero.dix <component.mero.dix_>`_]) rebalance.

.. _entity.metadata.external.dix.dtm0:

metadata.external.dix.dtm0
-----------------------------------

External metadata transactions are executed through dtm0. Failures during a distributed
transaction, e.g. node restart during object creation in [`mero.dix <component.mero.dix_>`_] using synchronous
replication scheme, are handled by redoing the incomplete part of the transaction.

.. _entity.metadata.external.directrebalance:

metadata.external.directrebalance
---------------------------------

Direct rebalance ([`dix.direct_rebalance <component.dix.direct_rebalance_>`_]) is triggered in case of permanent failures
such as metadata drive failure.


.. _entity.ha.halon.model:

ha.halon.model
--------------

TS
- replicas with quorum;
- persistence (optional, can be turned on and off);
- RC migration is invisible to other TS and SATs;
- can be connected to SATs and/or TSes.

SAT
- no persistence;
- can be connected to SATs and/or TSes;
- can communicate with other components.

Messaging
- messages are reliable: either the message is delivered or source and/or
  destination is failed permanently;
- messages between the same source and destination are ordered;
- the same message can't be delived twice;
- p2p messages:
  - TS to TS;
  - TS to SAT;
  - SAT to SAT;
  - TS or SAT to other component;
- broadcast messages:
  - TS to all SATs.
- message contains:
  - src
    - fid
    - current epoch
    - start epoch
    - software version
  - dst
    - fid (if available)
- message interface:
  - send() function
    - in
      - message
      - destination
    - out
      - error code (success, destination is dead)
  - received() callback


.. _entity.ha.state:

ha.state
--------

HA state is an attribute of a conf object [`conf.obj <entity.conf.obj_>`_] that tells what code
can do with the object.

List of HA states: ONLINE, TRANSIENT, FAILED.

The semantics of HA states may be different for different conf object types.

The users of HA states must assume that HA states may change at any moment.

pool
ONLINE - the pool can be used for I/O (data or metadata).
TRANSIENT - the pool must not be used for I/O.
FAILED - N/A.

node, process, service, sdev
ONLINE - the node/process/service is running, sdev can serve I/O requests.
TRANSIENT - the node/process/service is not running, but it may become ONLINE
again. sdev can't serve I/O requests.
FAILED - the node/process/service is not going to be running. All internal
states associated with the node/process/service can be wiped.

site/rack/enclosure/controller/drive
ONLINE - can be used now
TRANSIENT - can't be used right now, but may become ONLINE in the future.
FAILED - physically broken, needs replacement.

pver has no HA state. In every place where pver HA state may be needed the
pver's pool HA state must be used.

root has no HA state.

Use cases:
1. cluster start/stop;
2. mkfs;
3. dynamic clients;
4. software update;
5. failover;
6. process start (including BE recovery);
7. hardware addition/removal/replacement/movement;
8. software (node/process/service) addition/removal/replacement/movement;
9. admin disables something (that corresponds to a conf object) (puts HOLD);
10. cancelling of I/O operations;
11. state interpretation by current data and metadata I/O path;
12. DTM recovery;
13. fsck (interactive/non-interactive);
14. data integrity verification;
15. disaster recovery;
16. RC migration;
17. loss of TS quorum;
18. cluster management when there is no quorum;
19. detecting failed processes by rpc timeouts from other processes;
20. cluster mkfs/start/stop with missing/failed drives/nodes;
21. active RM migration;
22. 10k nodes scalability;
23. pool modifications;
24. controlled (m0d) and not controlled (clovis app) Mero processes.

Notes:
- fids are not reused;
- assumption: Halon doesn't use RPC for internal communications (need to
  verify);
- current client: Clovis, data/metadata I/O.

.. _entity.ha.state.hold:

ha.state.hold
-------------

A HOLD can be put on a conf object. The user can also remove a HOLD that was
put on a conf object before.

Semantics: a conf object with a HOLD can't have ONLINE HA state.

Internally each conf object has a bool flag called FAILED_FLAG that tells if
the object is failed or not and a list of HOLDs. HA state is calculated this
way:
- if the object has FAILED_FLAG set then it's in FAILED state;
- if the object has HOLDs then it's in TRANSIENT state;
- otherwise it's ONLINE.

Each HOLD has an owner. HOLD owner must be one of the conf objects in the
configuration or a Halon rule instance. HOLD is removed automatically iff:
- the conf object that is the owner is FAILED and it's not in the configuration;
- the rule instance that is the owner is finished.

HA state can be calculated ignoring a set of HOLDs. In this case the HA state
calculations are performed the same way as if every HOLD from the set doesn't
exist.

Each HOLD has 2 values associated with it: a 64-bit value and a short string.
The semantics of those values are defined by the HOLD owners are should be
completely ignored by everyone else.

Halon provides interfaces to put HOLDs on conf objects and to remove HOLDs from
conf objects.

.. _entity.ha.state.dependency:

ha.state.dependency
-------------------

There are state changes to conf objects that lead to state changes to another
objects. Such kind of state changes are called dependent state changes. They
are managed by Halon.

Dependent state changes are calculated without ignoring HOLDs.

HA states dependencies:
- if a node goes from ONLINE to TRANSIENT all processes on the node receive a
  HOLD with the node as the owner. The associated 64-bit value is 0, the string
  is "inherited". If the node goes back to ONLINE the hold is removed;
- the same HOLD logic is applied to a process and every service in this
  process;
- if a node has FAILED_FLAG set the FAILED_FLAG is set for all processes on the
  node;
- the same applies for a process with FAILED_FLAG set and all services in the
  process;
- if a drive goes to TRANSIENT or FAILED state a HOLD is put on all storage
  devices that are using this drive. The HOLD value is 0, the string is
  "dependent". If the drive goes back to ONLINE the HOLD is removed;
- the same logic applies to a controller and the controller's node.


.. _entity.ha.state.epoch:

ha.state.epoch
--------------

Each HA state change has an epoch associated with the change. The epoch is a
64-bit number.
TODO explain better.

HA epoch properties:
- If a state change to state_0 for an object with fid_0 happened in epoch_0,
  and then after some time a state change to state_1 happened with an object
  with fid_1 in epoch_1, then epoch_0 < epoch_1;
- dependent state changes (directly or indirectly) can have the same epoch.

Use of epoch:
- epoch is defined for a configuration, not for a single object;
- "Mero process uses HA epoch epoch_0" means the processe's latest received HA
  state change from Halon has HA epoch epoch_0;
- Mero RPC [`mero.rpc <component.mero.rpc_>`_] sends processes HA epoch in each rpc item and on the
  receiving end the epoch is compared (somehow) to the receiving processes HA
  epoch. Then RPC layer decides if it can process the rpc item.


.. _entity.ha.state.broadcast:

ha.state.broadcast
------------------

Halon decides when HA state of an object changes. On each such change Halon
broadcasts object fid and the new HA state to each Mero process. A set of HA
state changes can be broadcasted as a single broadcast message.

Properties:
- all Mero processes receive exactly the same HA state broadcast messages;
- if a Mero process receives broadcast messages A, then B, then C, then each
  Mero process receives them in the the following order: A, then B, then C,
  i.e. each process receives broadcast messages from Halon in exactly the same
  order.

The broadcast consists of:
- a set of (object fid, new object HA state) pairs;
- HA epoch.

All state changes for a single epoch are broadcasted in a single broadcast
message, i.e. 2 different broadcast messages must have 2 different HA epochs.
If a broadcast message with epoch_0 arrives before a broadcast message with
epoch_1, then epoch_0 < epoch_1.


.. _entity.ha.conf:

ha.conf
-------

Mero configuration for the HA purposes is defined as a subset of RG available
to Mero as a set of conf objects.


.. _entity.conf.object.categories:

conf.object.categories
----------------------

List of conf object categories:
- software: node, process, service, sdev;
- hardware: site, rack, enclosure, controller, drive;
- pools/profiles: profile, pool, pver, obj-v.


.. _entity.ha.hold.handler:

ha.hold.handler
---------------

HOLD handler is a set of methods and HOLD-based conditions.

Each conf object has a set of HOLD handlers. The HOLD handlers can be added
when the object is created and during the lifetime of the object. All HOLD
handlers are removed just before the object is destroyed and they can be
removed when the object is alive.

HOLD handler basic methods:
- add() is called when the HOLD handler is added to the conf object;
- del() is called when the HOLD handler is removed from the conf object.

Each condition has 2 HOLD handlers associated with it: one is called when the
condition changes state from False to True, another one is called when the
condition changes state from True to False.

HOLD handler methods signature:
- in: RG, conf object fid, last RC migration epoch;
- out: messages to send, RG diff, HOLD diff, HOLD handlers diff.

.. _entity.ha.hold.handler.queue:

ha.hold.handler.queue
---------------------

HA handler queue is a queue of HOLD handler methods.

Each conf object has a HOLD handler FIFO queue.

How the queue is managed:
- when an object is created it has initial list of HOLD handlers. For each HOLD
  handler add() method is added to the queue;
- when a new HOLD handler is added add() method is added to the queue;
- when it's decided that a conf object is going to be removed del() method for
  each HOLD handler is added to the queue in the reverse (relatively to the
  add() method) order;
- when a HOLD handler is removed from the object del() method for the HOLD
  handler is added to the queue;
- when a HOLD is added or removed from a conf object each condition for each
  HOLD handler is evaluated before and after the HOLD. If the condition changes
  state the corresponding method is added to the queue;
- after an add() or del() for a HOLD handler method is added to the queue the
  queue is scanned for the pairs of add() and del() methods for the same HOLD
  handler. If such pairs are foind both methods from the pair are removed from
  the queue;
- after a condition change method is added the queue is scanned to find pairs
  of condition change handlers for the same HOLD method. All methods from all
  such pairs are removed from the queue;

Options:
- option 1:
  - all methods from the queue are executed asynchronously, one by one. When
    the method finishes execution it's removed from the queue;
- option 2:
  - all methods from the queue are executed one by one. Each execution leads
    either to "method went to sleep" case or "method is done". If a method goes
    to sleep it's going to be executed next time it an be (tricky thing: how to
    determine this?). If the "method is done" it's removed from the queue.


.. _entity.conf.object.persistence:

conf.object.persistence
-----------------------

Each conf object has at least the following in a persistent storage (RG):
- fid;
- FAILED_FLAG;
- list of HOLDs;
- list of HOLD handlers;
- HOLD handler queue.
